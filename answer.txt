The .gitignore file contains ignore rules. It specifically contains rules that are meant to be shared through the repository. gitignore should list the names or name-patterns of files that will be found in work-trees when working with your project, but that should not be committed to the project.
A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead the one you have checked-out. 
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.
You can have as many remotes as you want, but you can only have one remote named "origin".
